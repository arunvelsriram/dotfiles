# edit the following file: /etc/pam.d/sudo
# and add the following line after the initial comment line:
#   `auth sufficient pam_tid.so`
# This script also verifies that this line is added only once (ie skips if already present)

# TODO: Need to ensure that TouchId hardware is present before running this script
