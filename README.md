Repo to hold my Mac OS X configurations. Helps to setup my Mac easily in case of failure or replacement.

Use at your own risk!

Review the code and remove things that are not necessary to you before setting this up on your Mac.  

A backup of the existing dotfiles will be placed inside `dotfiles.backup.{date}` during the setup. Use this to restore your old dotfiles in case you mess up.
